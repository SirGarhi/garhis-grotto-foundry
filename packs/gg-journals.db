through downtime via Experimenting.</p></li><li><p>In order to attempt to earn a Core Feature through Experimenting, you must know a specific formula for a consumable of that type.</p><ul><li><p>You must actually <em>know</em> a formula, not simply have an Inspiration for one.</p></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>Without working from a known formula, the resulting output is entirely unpredictable and up to the DM's whimsy.</p></blockquote><h2>Tools Required</h2><p>Each type of consumable has an associated tool that is generally used to craft it. Check with your DM to see if you can use a different type of tool instead.</p><ul><li><p>Potions and Potion Serums are brewed with an Herbalism Kit.</p></li><li><p>Weapon Oils, Poisons, and Coatings are made with a Poisoner's Kit.</p></li><li><p>Canister Bombs are crafted with an Alchemist's Kit.</p></li><li><p>Arrows or Bolts are crafted with Woodcarver's Tools.</p></li><li><p>Bullets are crafted with Tinker's Tools.</p></li></ul><p>You must be at least proficient with the tool used in order to create an item safely.</p><p>With one hour's work you can safely create a single output from any formulae you know by expending the appropriate resources.</p><p>You can attempt to forego safety and rapidly craft one output in 10 minutes.</p><h2>Unsafe Crafting</h2><p>If you are attempting to craft in an unsafe manor, you must make an Ability Check with your tool against a Base DC equal to 10 + the Tier of the item you are trying to make, modified based on what factors are making the crafting attempt unsafe:</p><ul><li><p>Not having the core feature to craft that type of consumable: +5</p></li><li><p>Not being proficient in the tool you are using: +5</p></li><li><p>Rapid Crafting: +3</p></li><li><p>Any other modifiers the DM feels are appropriate, such as an environmental factor like being in the back of a jostling cart.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>As with any check, the DM may not even allow an attempt if the modified DC is too high to be realistically accomplished.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>On a success, you manage to produce one output from the formula.</p></li><li><p>On a failure, you lose half the resources required to make the item.</p></li><li><p>If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.</p></li></ul><p>The DM may also stipulate that there is some other consequence for a catastrophic failure, such as accidentally poisoning yourself or having a bomb blow up in your face.</p><p></p><h1>Acquiring New Formulae</h1><p>Whatever type of consumable you're crafting, you need to work from an established formula to get predictable results.</p><p>Here are some ways you might learn new formulae:</p><ul><li><p>Randomly Discovered – Such as written on an old scroll in an abandoned laboratory.</p></li><li><p>Purchased – Check with other practitioners such as Apothecaries, Herbalists, or members of the Explosives Guild to see if they know any formulae they will sell or teach you.</p></li><li><p>Experimentation – Downtime spent trying various different approaches to make something as of yet unknown to you.</p></li></ul><h2>Experimenting</h2><p>Experimenting to develop a formula requires that you have the core feature for that type of consumable.</p><p>Experimenting consumes resources from failed attempts, it's up to the DM precisely how this works but here is a sample system:</p><ul><li><p>After one hour spent experimenting make an Ability Check using your tool against a DC equal to 15 + the Tier the formula would be from.</p></li><li><p>If you succeed you gain one success.</p></li><li><p>On a failure, you consume half the resources it would normally take to brew this serum.</p></li><li><p>If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.</p></li><li><p>Once you have accumulated 3 successes, you learn the formula.</p></li></ul><h2>Inspiration</h2><p>Certain things can clue your character in to new consumables being possible. In such an instance, you are considered to have earned an Inspiration for that specific consumable.</p><p>You don't need to have the core feature for a type of consumable to earn an Inspiration for a consumable of that type, but you must first earn the core feature before you can actually develop a formula based on the Inspiration.</p><p>Developing a formula from an Inspiration is significantly easier than coming up with an idea from scratch, and only requires you dedicate the downtime to experimenting with no checks needed.</p><p>Some Sample Inspirations:</p><ul><li><p>Harvesting Mimic Adhesive could grant Inspiration for a Glue Bomb.</p></li><li><p>Being subjected to a Wall of Fire spell could grant Inspiration for a Blaze Bomb.</p></li><li><p>Being on the receiving end of a nasty poison could grant Inspiration for a Weapon Oil with similar effect.</p></li><li><p>Drinking a potion you don't know the formula for, or seeing an unknown bomb type in action may grant you Inspiration to replicate that consumable.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Arcane Ammunition","type":"text","_id":"edLNmoCpt1P387FZ","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>Basic Mechanics</h1><p>@UUID[.rShlIPUan1HGWv6B]{Shared Mechanics}</p><p>Arcane Ammunition refers to any ammunition that is infused with magical energy in some fashion.</p><p>Some Ammunition Types require a Saving Throw, the DC is determined by your Ammo DC.</p><ul><li><p>Ammo DC: 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Dexterity Modifier</p></li></ul><h1>Storage and Handling</h1><p>Ammunition, even of an arcane variety, doesn't require any special care while handling or storing it.

{"name":"1 - Character Path Design Document","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Path Design & Mechanics","type":"text","_id":"h2a28ONBRHHLWlbV","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>Term Definitions</h1><ul><li><p><strong>Path</strong> – The set of Tiers for a specific character. Think of it as a roadmap for how the character may develop.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tier</strong> – A collection of features of similar power level.</p></li><li><p><strong>Feature</strong> – Can be potentially anything, but generally an effect, an ability, or the initial acquisition of a specific piece of equipment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Effect</strong> – A bonus of some sort that is applied without requiring an action on the part of the player. An upgrade to a weapon to make it deal an additional 1d4 damage on every hit would be an effect.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ability</strong> – Something that requires an action on the part of the player to trigger. Using a Bonus Action to cast a spell you otherwise wouldn't have access to would be an ability.</p></li></ul><h1>Design Notes</h1><p>Players should have significant input on what their Path contains, as well as some of what they may need to accomplish to earn more significant features from higher tiers.</p><p>A feature can be literally anything. Here are some examples of the most common types.</p><ul><li><p>An upgrade to or the crafting of a specific piece of equipment such as:</p><ul><li><p> Enchanting an heirloom battle axe to be a +1 weapon.</p></li><li><p> Imbuing a thrown weapon with the Returning property.</p></li><li><p> Modifying the sights on a firearm to give it an increased range.</p></li><li><p> A Mithril War Hammer that is no longer versatile but can now be thrown.</p></li><li><p> A Heavy Reach weapon that deals Bludgeoning Damage.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>An effect upgrade to the character themselves such as:</p><ul><li><p>Inflicting a lingering damage over time effect when you critically hit with a melee attack with a two-handed weapon.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A custom character ability such as</p><ul><li><p>The ability to Hide as a Bonus Action if you're Invisible.</p></li><li><p>The ability to make an attack as a bonus action under specific conditions.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Replicating some or all of an existing feat, class feature, or magic item such as:</p><ul><li><p>Ability to automatically succeed on a failed Concentration check, as per the Artificer Mind Sharpener Infusion.</p></li><li><p>The ability to penetrate Resistance with a chosen element as in the Elemental Adept feat.</p></li><li><p>An effect that adds Spell Modifier damage to a specific cantrip, as in the Warlock's Agonizing Blast.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Expanding upon existing class features or feats the character already has such as:</p><ul><li><p>A new Battle Master Maneuver that uses and scales with your regular Superiority Dice.</p></li><li><p>Being able to use the ability to apply poisons as a Bonus Action from the Poisoner Feat on other types of consumables.</p></li><li><p>The ability to temporarily select an additional option for class features with multiple choices, such as Eldritch Invocations or the Totem Warrior Barbarian's animal spirits.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Feature Scaling</h2><p>Avoid Features that automatically scale when possible.</p><p>Instead of granting an Ability with uses equal to Proficiency Bonus, which will automatically improve just by leveling, consider giving it 2-3 uses when first earned and then adding another Feature at a higher tier that grants that ability additional uses. </p><p>Paths are about continual but incremental improve, and Features should require continued and somewhat focused effort to improve.</p><h2>Don't Tunnel Vision On Combat</h2><p>Not everything needs to be mechanically significant or impactful in combat.</p><p>Sometimes features that serve no mechanical purpose other than flavor are great. Here's an example of one of those types of features:</p><ul><li><p>A dress pocket that manifests on whatever dress you are wearing and always has some of your favorite food inside when you blindly put your hand in it, but appears empty if you open it to look.</p></li></ul><p>Also, depending on the style of campaign you are running, don't neglect features that mostly have an impact in the Social or Exploration pillars of play, such as these:</p><ul><li><p>Gain a +1d4 bonus to your Charisma (Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation) checks while wearing flashy clothes.</p></li><li><p>Impose disadvantage on another creature's Insight check to read your intentions.</p></li><li><p>Making any knowledge checks as if you had Expertise when researching in a library.</p></li></ul><h2>A note on 'Balance'</h2><p>In accordance with my overall design philosophy, balance is only important insofar as it isn't causing friction at the table. There are no hard and fast rules such as point budgets or certain features being 'worth' more than other ones. If it <em><strong>feels</strong></em> good to all the players at the table (including the DM) then it <em><strong>is</strong></em> good.</p><p>There are no hard and fast rules as to which Tier a feature should be placed in either. The one exception being Tiered Effects, a Feature granting a +3 bonus should be in a higher Tier, and also likely require a lower Tier Feature as a prerequisite, than one that provides a +2 or +1 bonus of the same type.</p><p>Each character's path is unique, what might be a Tier 5 Feature for one character's Path could easily be a Tier 3 Feature for another character's Path and have it still feel good.</p><h1>Paths Aren't Static</h1><p>Paths aren't always straight, and travel along a path doesn't always go to plan. Paths should be updated, altered, or otherwise adjusted as necessary to reflect the changing nature of the game and character.</p><p>Likewise sometimes a feature will sound really good on paper but at the table doesn't play well. Path Features are always subject to change and the DM always has the final say on what precisely a feature does.</p><p>Some common types of adjustments you might make:</p><ul><li><p>Changing a feature that was initially designed as at-will to be limited use</p></li><li><p>Adding a feature to a higher tier that grants a lower tier feature more uses</p></li><li><p>Adjusting damage numbers or durations, having an ability that imposes disadvantage on an attack impact two attacks instead of one can make a huge difference in how the ability feels.</p></li></ul><p>Sometimes features just don't feel good no matter what you do and should be scrapped entirely in favor of a new approach or a completely different direction.</p><h1>Path Features are <strong>NOT</strong> Player Entitlements</h1><p>A Path is a planning document. It speaks to <em>intent</em> or <em>desire</em> but it is most definitely not a contractual guarantee that a character <em>will</em> earn every (or even <em>any</em>) of the Features listed in it. It also makes no promises for a timeline as to when features might be earned, regardless of what tier they are in.</p><blockquote><p>As a Player, unless the DM has explicitly awarded you with a Path Feature, you don't have it.</p></blockquote><p>Path Features are not necessarily permanent either. Losing a Path Feature that was already earned is a potentially fantastic narrative consequence.</p><h1>Awarding New Features</h1><p>Path Features are meant to be a way to tangibly and often mechanically reward players for accomplishing narrative goals.</p><p>Tiers are collections of features based on relative power level and an intended overall progression path, they are not bundles of features to be awarded all at once.</p><p>Features within a tier can and should be earned individually unless they are tightly coupled, such as the ability to craft custom ammunition for a weapon that only fires said custom ammunition.</p><p>Depending on your campaign and starting character level, characters may start with some features already earned.</p><hr><p>Character Paths have 6 Tiers of progression, but tiers are only general guidelines. In large part Tiers exist because without them a Path would be extremely difficult to read or make sense of.</p><p>Outside of features with explicit prerequisites, it is not strictly necessary to award features from a lower tier before starting to award features from a higher tier.</p><p>That being said, if you find yourself consistently awarding higher tier features before awarding lower tier ones, an Audit of the Path is probably in order to determine if those features are placed in the appropriate tiers to begin with.</p><p>The listing order of features within a tier in a Path Summary has no significance.</p><hr><p>As a general guideline, features within Tiers 1-2 should be earnable by quite attainable means for a low level character such as:</p><ul><li><p>Throwing money or resources at it</p><ul><li><p>Paying a trainer a modest sum of gold to receive a lesson.</p></li><li><p>Expending an uncommon or rare aetheric essence to enchant an effect on to an item.</p></li><li><p>Upgrading or crafting a weapon with the right rarity of materials.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Randomly bumping in to something during normal adventuring:</p><ul><li><p>Finding a dusty old scroll in a tomb that teaches the techniques for a more efficient means of making potions or poisons.</p></li><li><p>Discovering the ancient writings of a warrior that can teach a new Battle Master Maneuver.</p></li><li><p>Getting a cat down out of a tree that turns out to be an all powerful witch's familiar and rewards you with an additional spell known.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Tier 3 and higher is when you should really start considering if a given feature should have some sort of narrative tie in or specific objective to earn, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Traveling to three different cities to train with three different weapon masters.</p></li><li><p>Uncovering a deeply hidden family secret masking the source of the family's power.</p></li><li><p>Tracking down a rare albino owlbear to gather some of its feathers.</p></li></ul><p>Just because a feature is in a higher tier doesn't mean it <strong>requires</strong> some special means of earning however. Upgrading a weapon bonus from +1 to +2 doesn't need to be more complicated than throwing the right quantity and rarity of resources at it.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"PCQleWS0iS4nC1hT":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.98rrccYLZuplRkyj"},"cf":{"id":"temp_a16p6wnvcil"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677966818949,"modifiedTime":1678469760930,"lastModifiedBy":"PCQleWS0iS4nC1hT"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"lJlLHh6IHst7ZSCD"}

Losing a Path Feature that was already earned is a potentially fantastic narrative consequence.</p><h1>Awarding New Features</h1><p>Path Features are meant to be a way to tangibly and often mechanically reward players for accomplishing meaningful things in the narrative (whether they were an intentional goal or not.)</p><p>Tiers are collections of features based on relative power level and an intended overall progression path, they are not bundles of features to be awarded all at once.</p><p>Features within a tier can and should be earned individually unless they are tightly coupled, such as the ability to craft custom ammunition for a weapon that only fires said custom ammunition.</p><p>The listing order of features within a tier in a Path Summary has no significance.</p><p>Depending on your campaign and starting character level, characters may start with some features already earned.</p><hr /><p>Character Paths have 6 Tiers of progression, but tiers are only general guidelines. In large part Tiers exist because without them a Path would be extremely difficult to read or make sense of.</p><p>Outside of features with explicit prerequisites, it is not strictly necessary to award features from a lower tier before starting to award features from a higher tier.</p><p>That being said, if you find yourself consistently awarding higher tier features before awarding lower tier ones, an Audit of the Path is probably in order to determine if those features are placed in the appropriate tiers to begin with.</p><hr /><p>As a general guideline, features within Tiers 1-2 should be earnable by quite attainable means for a low level character such as:</p><ul><li><p>Throwing money or resources at it</p><ul><li><p>Paying a trainer a modest sum of gold to receive a lesson.</p></li><li><p>Expending an uncommon or rare aetheric essence to enchant an effect on to an item.</p></li><li><p>Upgrading or crafting a weapon with the right rarity of materials.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Randomly bumping in to something during normal adventuring:</p><ul><li><p>Finding a dusty old scroll in a tomb that teaches the techniques for a more efficient means of making potions or poisons.</p></li><li><p>Discovering the ancient writings of a warrior that can teach a new Battle Master Maneuver.</p></li><li><p>Getting a cat down out of a tree that turns out to be an all powerful witch's familiar and rewards you with an additional spell known.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Tier 3 and higher is when you should really start considering if a given feature should have some sort of narrative tie in or specific objective to earn, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Traveling to three different cities to train with three different weapon masters.</p></li><li><p>Uncovering a deeply hidden family secret masking the source of the family's power.</p></li><li><p>Tracking down a rare albino owlbear to gather some of its feathers.</p></li></ul><p>Just because a feature is in a higher tier doesn't mean it <strong>requires</strong> some special means of earning however. Upgrading a weapon bonus from +1 to +2 doesn't need to be more complicated than throwing the right quantity and rarity of resources at it.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"PCQleWS0iS4nC1hT":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.98rrccYLZuplRkyj"},"cf":{"id":"temp_a16p6wnvcil"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677966818949,"modifiedTime":1678472195054,"lastModifiedBy":"PCQleWS0iS4nC1hT"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"lJlLHh6IHst7ZSCD"}
