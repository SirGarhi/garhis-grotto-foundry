They serve near identical purposes but the approach can vary wildly. Cillian's kit is a <em>Theoretical</em> kit.</p><p><strong>Kit DC</strong> – Your Kit DC is equal to 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Intelligence modifier.</p><p>Your Kit DC determines the Save DC of consumables made by the kit, including bombs, poisons, and oils.</p><p><strong>Proficiency</strong> – Your Proficiency level for using the kit itself is determined by the highest aptitude you have from among Alchemist’s Supplies, Poisoner’s Kit, and Herbalism Kit.</p><p><strong>Multifunction</strong> – This kit can serve the purpose of Alchemist’s Supplies, Poisoner’s Kit, or Herbalism Kit.</p><p><strong>Formulae</strong> – Brewing Oils or Serums, or Making Bombs requires a known Formula to work from. Formulae can be found as loot, uncovered through research and study in downtime, occasionally found for sale in shops, or created through experimentation. Work with your DM to establish what formulae you already know as part of basic proficiency with the kit.</p><h2><span style=\"font-family:EBGaramond\">Potion Serums</span></h2><p>A serum can be readily drunk or administered to a willing creature as an Action. Administering a Serum to an unwilling creature requires a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (their choice). If you are hidden from the creature you make your check with Advantage and they have Disadvantage on their check.</p><h2><span style=\"font-family:EBGaramond\">Weapon Oils</span></h2><p>Oils can be applied to a weapon as a bonus action. Oils persist on the weapon until a successful attack is made.</p><h2><span style=\"font-family:EBGaramond\">Prepared Brewing</span></h2><p>With one hour of work, which can be accomplished over a short rest, you can brew up to 3 vials of Potion Serums or Weapon Oils by utilizing the formulae you know and expending the appropriate resources.</p><h2><span style=\"font-family:EBGaramond\">Vial Belt</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">A specialized arm or leg band that can hold up to 3 vials of Serums. Drinking one of these vials only requires a Bonus Action (It is still an action to administer the Serum to another creature).

Think of it as a roadmap for how the character may develop.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\"><strong>Tier</strong> – A collection of features of similar power level.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\"><strong>Feature</strong> – Either an effect or an ability.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\"><strong>Effect</strong> – A bonus of some sort that is applied without requiring an action on the part of the player. An upgrade to a weapon to make it deal an additional 1d4 damage on every hit would be an effect.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\"><strong>Ability</strong> – Something that requires an action on the part of the player to trigger. Using a Bonus Action to cast a spell you otherwise wouldn't have access to would be an ability.</span></p></li></ul><h1><span style=\"font-family:EBGaramond\">Awarding New Features</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Tiers are collections of features based on relative power level. They are not bundles of features to be awarded all at once. Features within a tier can and should be earned individually unless they are tightly coupled, such as the ability to craft a bomb with the recipe of a specific type of bomb. Gaining one without the other doesn't feel good as a player and should be avoided in general.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Depending on your campaign and starting character level, characters may start with some features already earned.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:EBGaramond\">Design Notes</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Players should have significant input on what their Path contains, as well as some of what they may need to accomplish to earn more significant features from higher tiers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">A feature can be literally anything. The most common features are things like upgrades to a specific piece of equipment, such as enchanting a family heirloom battle axe, or character abilities like a new custom battle master maneuver. More interesting or unique things can be features as well though, like a dress pocket that always has some of your favorite food when you put your hand in it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Not everything needs to be mechanically significant or impactful in combat. Sometimes features that serve no purpose other than flavor are great. Also, depending on the style of campaign you are running, don't neglect features that mostly have an impact in the Social or Exploration pillars of play.</span></p><hr /><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Paths aren't always straight, and travel along a path doesn't always go to plan. Paths should be updated, altered, and otherwise adjusted as necessary to reflect the changing nature of the game and character arcs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Likewise sometimes a feature will sound really good on paper but at the table doesn't play well. Path features are always subject to change and the DM always has the final say on what precisely a feature does.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">In accordance with my overall design philosophy, <em>balance</em> is only important insofar as it isn't causing friction at the table. There are no hard and fast rules about point budgets or certain features being more or less expensive than other ones. If it <em><strong>feels</strong></em> good to all the players at the table (including the DM) then it <em>is</em> good.</span></p><hr /><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Character Paths have 6 Tiers of progression. It is not required but it will often be the case that a character earns every feature from a given tier before earning a feature from the next tier.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">The listing order of features within a Tier in a Path writeup has no significance.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">As a general guideline, features within Tiers 1-3 should be earnable mostly by quite attainable means such as:</span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Gaining access to uncommon or rare crafting materials</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Paying a trainer to receive a lesson</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Discovering a formula or recipe in a dungeon by accident</span></p></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Tier 4 and higher is when features should start requiring some sort of narrative tie in or specific objective to earn such as:</span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Traveling to three different cities to train with three different weapon masters</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">Tracking down a rare albino owlbear to gather its feathers</span></p></li></ul><hr /><p><span style=\"font-family:CrimsonPro\">There are no hard and fast rules as to which Tier a feature should be placed in. Obviously a Feature that provides a +3 bonus should be in a higher Tier than one that provides a +2 or +1 bonus of the same type. What might be a Tier 5 Feature for one character's Path could easily be a Tier 3 Feature for another character's Path though.</span></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"PCQleWS0iS4nC1hT":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.98rrccYLZuplRkyj"},"cf":{"id":"temp_a16p6wnvcil"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677966818949,"modifiedTime":1678040892643,"lastModifiedBy":"PCQleWS0iS4nC1hT"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"lJlLHh6IHst7ZSCD"}
