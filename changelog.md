* Twilight Sanctuary - Twilight Cleric Feature
* Clockwork Bolt - Cantrip
* Booming Blade - Cantrip
* Green Flame Blade - Cantrip
* Auto Reckless - Optional Barbarian Feature
## Fixes

* Fixed Hex/Hunter's Mark
* Fixed Hunger of Hadar
* Fixed Twilight Sanctuary
## Changes
* Sneak Attack - refactor to no longer rely on a world macro
* Booming Blade - refactor to act as a Damage Bonus Macro so it has it's own entry on the chat card, removed reliance on world macros, removed different Potent vs. Non-Potent versions
* Green Flame Blade - similar refactor to Booming Blade
* Clockwork Bolt - similar refactor to Booming Blade
* Auto Reckless - refactor to remove world macro
## New
* Added Flaming Sphere
* Updated Cloud of Daggers and Flaming Sphere to support picking a damage type to support scribes wizards, no validation checking to filter the possible choices at this time.
* Rallying Mark Automation for Warlord
* Heroic Strike Automation for Warlord
* Urgent Orders/Helpful Word resource spending
## Character Paths
* All non-played character's path abilities should be considered broken at this stage, most won't take much work to fix but not a priority unless someone starts using a similar ability.
* Fixed Bhalgrim's Richochet Attack
## Awakend Weapons
* Should be considered entirely obsolete and broken, kept around for inspirational purposes, Kivi's Symbiote was an especially cool design imo.
