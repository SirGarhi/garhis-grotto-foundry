These ancestral blades belong to the Corwin dynastic line. They were long since thought lost forever, with most believing them to be only myth until they were located, recovered, and reunited by Raeyan Corwin.

Currently wielded by Drake 'Mento' Corwin after receiving them as a surprise gift from his Great Aunt Raeyan.
