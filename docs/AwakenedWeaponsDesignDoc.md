These style of items are heavily based upon the Awakened Blades framework, with some customizations and clarifications.
# General Mechanics
## Term Definitions
* Feature – Either an effect or an ability.
* Effect – A bonus of some sort that is applied without requiring an action on the part of the players. Such as a weapon dealing an additional 1d4 damage with each hit.
* Ability – Something that requires an action on the part of the player to trigger, such as using a Bonus Action to cast a specific spell.
* Passive – A feature that is always available once earned.
* Active – A feature that is only available when the appropriate tier of power is considered 'active.'
* Tier – A collection of features of similar power level.

## Tiers of Power
There are three overall Tiers to an Awakened Style weapon:
* Base – These features are all passive.
* Awakened – There's usually a mix of passive and active features here.
* True Awakened – These abilities and effects are primarily active, but it's not uncommon for there to be a passive one or two as well.

## Awarding New Features
It's important to note that individual features from the tiers of power can be awarded individually. You don't need to give out the entire tier as a single comprehensive package. Of course, there are some features that are tightly coupled. Awarding an active feature necessitates also awarding the ability that activates that tier of power so the player can actually use the feature.

Depending on your campaign and starting character level, the initial versions of items players find or start with may have some or all of the Base Tier abilities and effects already.

There aren't hard and fast rules as to when players should be able to earn features from different tiers, but there are a few guidelines:
* In general, a Player should expect to earn all of one tier before earning anything from the next tier.
* Base Tier features awarded between levels 1 and 6-8 or so.
* Awakened Tier features start being awarded around level 7-9.
* True Awakened Tier features start being awarded around level 12-15.

Again, these aren't hard and fast rules. It's always better to tie the earning of a feature to a narrative event than just because the character reached an arbitrary level.

## Bonuses to Attack, Damage, and Save DC
Every Awakened Style weapon is assumed to include an unlisted growing bonus to Attack Rolls, Damage Rolls, and Spell or Ability DC.

This bonus is not tied directly to which tier of power the item has achieved, but instead is a separate progression track.

A good rule of thumb is that the weapon will achieve a +1 bonus upon earning an Awakened Tier feature, a +2 bonus upon earning a True Awakened Tier feature, and a +3 bonus upon unlocking the entirety of the True Awakened Tier.

# Awakening Mechanics
You Awaken your weapon as a Bonus Action on your turn, gaining access to all Active features you have earned from the Awakened Tier for the duration of the weapon's awakening, which lasts for one hour.

You can Awaken your weapon once, and regain the ability to do so at the end of a Long Rest.

At the DM's discretion, though generally expected by around the time you start earning True Awakened Tier features, you can earn the feature to regain the ability to Awaken after a Short Rest as well as a Long Rest.

# True Awakening Mechanics
## Term Definitions
* Durability – A measure of how long your weapon can remain in it's Truly Awoken state.
* Toll – The effects inflicted on your character for activating the True Awakening.

## Design Notes
Most of the Toll effects are designed with the Exhaustion mechanics of the One D&D playtest in mind. These mechanics provide a linear scale of exhaustion penalties so you can be more liberal with applying it. A Toll of 3 Exhaustion Levels will certainly be felt by the player, but it's not cripplingly debilitating to the point that the character becomes effectively useless in combat.

## True Awakening Process
You Truly Awaken your weapon as an Action on your turn. When you activate your True Awakening, your Awakening also activates at the same time with no additional action cost and without expending an allotted use of that ability.

At the start of each of your turns, your Durability goes down by 1.

Certain active abilities may come with an additional cost to your Durability. If you don't have enough Durability left to cover the cost, you can't use these abilities.

At the end of your turn, if your Durability is 0, your True Awakening ends and you immediately suffer the Toll.

Your Awakening continues to persists for the entire hour as if you had activated it normally.
