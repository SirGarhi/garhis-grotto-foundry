## Term Definitions
* Path – The set of Tiers for a specific character. Think of it as a roadmap for how the character may develop.
* Tier – A collection of features of similar power level.
* Feature – Either an effect or an ability.
* Effect – A bonus of some sort that is applied without requiring an action on the part of the player. An upgrade to a weapon to make it deal an additional 1d4 damage on every hit would be an effect.
* Ability – Something that requires an action on the part of the player to trigger. Using a Bonus Action to cast a spell you otherwise wouldn't have access to would be an ability.

## Design Notes
Players should have significant input on what their Path contains, as well as some of what they may need to accomplish to earn more significant features from higher tiers.

A feature can be literally anything. Here are some examples of the most common types.
* An upgrade to or the crafting of a specific piece of equipment such as
	- Enchanting an heirloom battle axe to be a +1 weapon
	- Imbuing a thrown weapon with the Returning property
	- Modifying the sights on a firearm to give it an increased range
	- A Mithril War Hammer that is no longer versatile but can now be thrown
	- A Heavy Reach weapon that deals Bludgeoning Damage
* An Effect upgrade to the character themselves such as
	- Healing for an additional 1d4 with every spell that does healing
* A custom character ability such as
	- Inflicting a damage over time condition when you hit with a melee weapon attack
	- The ability to make an attack as a bonus action under specific conditions
* Replicating some or all of an existing feat, class feature, or magic item such as
	- Ability to automatically succeed on a failed Concentration check, as per the Artificer Mind Sharpener Infusion
	- The ability to penetrate Resistance with a chosen element as in the Elemental Adept feat
	- An effect that adds Spell Modifier damage to a specific cantrip, as in the Warlock's Agonizing Blast
* Expanding upon existing class features or feats the character already has such as:
	- The abilty to craft other types of weapon coatings using the mechanics of the Poisoner feat
	- A new Battle Master Maneuver that uses and scales with your regular Superiority Dice
	- The ability to temporarily select an additional option for class features with multiple choices, such as Eldritch Invocations or the Totem Warrior Barbarian's animal spirits

Not everything needs to be mechanically significant or impactful in combat. Sometimes features that serve no purpose other than flavor are great. Here's an example of one of those types of features:
* A dress pocket that manifests on whatever dress you are wearing and always has some of your favorite food inside when you blindly put your hand in it, but appears empty if you open it to look.

Also, depending on the style of campaign you are running, don't neglect features that mostly have an impact in the Social or Exploration pillars of play, such as these:
* Gain a +1d4 bonus to your Charisma (Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation) checks
* Impose disadvantage on another creature's insight check to read your intentions
* Making any knowledge checks as if you had Expertise when researching in a library

### Be Open to Change
Paths aren't always straight, and travel along a path doesn't always go to plan. Paths should be updated, altered, or otherwise adjusted as necessary to reflect the changing nature of the game and characters.

Likewise sometimes a feature will sound really good on paper but at the table doesn't play well. Path Features are always subject to change and the DM always has the final say on what precisely a feature does.

Some common types of adjustments you might make:
* Changing a feature that was initially designed as at-will to be limited use
* Adding a feature to a higher tier that grants a lower tier feature more uses
* Adjusting damage numbers or durations, having an ability that imposes disadvantage on an attack impact two attacks instead of one can make a huge difference in how the ability feels.

Sometimes features just don't feel good no matter what you do and should be scrapped entirely in favor of a new approach or a completely different direction.

### A note on "Balance"
In accordance with my overall design philosophy, balance is only important insofar as it isn't causing friction at the table. There are no hard and fast rules such as point budgets or certain features being 'worth' more than other ones. If it **feels** good to all the players at the table (including the DM) then it *is* good.

There are no hard and fast rules as to which Tier a feature should be placed in either. The one exception being Tiered Effects, a Feature granting a +3 bonus should be in a higher Tier than one that provides a +2 or +1 bonus of the same type. 

Each character's path is unique, what might be a Tier 5 Feature for one character's Path could easily be a Tier 3 Feature for another character's Path and have it still feel good.

## Awarding New Features
Tiers are collections of features based on relative power level and an intended overall progression path. They are not bundles of features to be awarded all at once. Features within a tier can and should be earned individually unless they are tightly coupled, such as gaining the ability to craft bombs necessitating also gaining the formula for at least one type of bomb. I will note the reverse to that example doesn't necessarily hold. A player could uncover the formula for a type of bomb without knowing how to make bombs, and then use the formula as the catalyst to start experimenting and earn the feature to actually craft bombs in general.

Depending on your campaign and starting character level, characters may start with some features already earned.

Character Paths have 6 Tiers of progression. It is not required but it will often be the case that a character earns every feature from a given tier before earning a feature from the next tier.

The listing order of features within a Tier in a Path writeup has no significance.

As a general guideline, features within Tiers 1-2 and to a lesser extent Tier 3 should be earnable by quite attainable means for a low level character such as:
* Throwing money or resources at it
	- Paying a trainer a modest sum of gold to receive a lesson
	- Expending an uncommon or rare aetheric essence to enchant an effect on to an item
	- Upgrading or crafting a weapon with the right rarity of materials
* Randomly bumping in to something during normal adventuring
	- Finding a dusty old scroll in a tomb that teaches the techniques for a more efficient means of making potions or poisons

Tier 4 and higher is when features should start requiring some sort of narrative tie in or specific objective to earn such as:
* Traveling to three different cities to train with three different weapon masters
* Uncovering a deeply hidden family secret masking the source of the family's power
* Tracking down a rare albino owlbear to gather some of its feathers
