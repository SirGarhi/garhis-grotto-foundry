# Basic Mechanics
[Shared Crafting and Formula Mechanics](consumable_shared_mechanics.md)

Potion Serums are a specialized type of potion that deal primarily in lingering and long-lasting effects.
* A serum can be administered in a number of different way:
	* Drunk by yourself as an Action.
	* Fed to a willing or unconscious creature as an Action.
	* Forcibly administered to an unwilling creature as an Action:
		* You must make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (their choice).
		* If you are hidden from the creature you make your check with Advantage and they make their check with Disadvantage.

# Storage and Handling
Potion Serums are kept in fragile vials. You can safely store some loosely in a container such as a Backpack without issue, but trying to carry too many may have unforeseen consequences as determined by the DM.

Potion Serums can be safely stored in a bag of holding or similar extradimensional space.

> Player Note: The name of the game here is **be reasonable**. It's not intended that you carry around 200 Serums, even if you technically could safely through use of a bag of holding or similar.

A piece of equipment known as a **Vial Belt** can be crafted using leatherworker's tools and 2 units of Uncommon Leather. It provides the following benefits:
* A Vial Belt has the capacity to safely store 3 Potion Serums.
* As an Action, you can safely add, remove, or swap any number of serums from the belt.
* You can store a single filled Vial Belt in a container such as a Backpack safely. They are also easily stored in a cart or horse's saddlebags.
* Worn around the arm or leg, a vial belt provides easy access to the vials stored in it.
* You may Administer a Potion Serum stored in a worn vial belt to yourself as a Bonus Action provided you have a free hand to do so.
* Unless you have another feature stating differently, you may only wear two vial belts at a time.
