# Basic Mechanics
Potion Serums are a specialized type of potion that deal primarily in lingering and long-lasting effects.
* You must have the basic knowledge of brewing potion serums in general in order to safely brew *any* serum.
	* Simply finding a formula is not enough to grant you this knowledge. It must be taught by another or learned in downtime via experimentation.
* Potion Serums are brewed using an Herbalism Kit in addition to any needed ingredients.
	* It may be possible to substitue a different tool, such as Alchemist's Supplies. Check with your DM.
* You must be at least proficient with an Herbalism Kit in order to brew serums safely.
* With one hour's work you can safely brew a single serum from any formulae you know.
* You can attempt to forego safety and rapidly brew a serum in 10 minutes.
* If you are attempting to brew a serum in an unsafe manor, you must make an Ability Check with an Herbalism Kit against a DC equal to 12 + the Tier of the serum you are trying to make.
	* On a success, you manage to make the serum.
	* On a failure, you lose half the resources required to make the serum.
	* If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.
		* The DM may also stipulate that there is some other consequence for a catastrophic failure, such as accidentally poisoning yourself.
	* The DM may impose additional modifiers to the DC.
* A serum can be administered in a number of different way:
	* Drunk by yourself as an Action.
	* Fed to a willing or unconscious creature as an Action.
	* Forcibly administered to an unwilling creature as an Action:
		* You must make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (their choice).
		* If you are hidden from the creature you make your check with Advantage and they make their check with Disadvantage.

# Storage and Handling
Potion Serums are kept in fragile vials. You can safely store up to 5 Potion Serums in a container such as a Backpack without issue, trying to carry more may have unforseen consequences as determined by the DM.

Potion Serums can be safely stored in a bag of holding or similar extradimensional space.

A piece of equipment known as a ***Vial Belt*** can be crated using leatherworker's tools and 2 units of Uncommon Leather. It provides the following benefits:
* A Vial Belt has the capacity to safely store 3 Potion Serums.
* As an Action, you can safely add, remove, or swap any number of serums from the belt.
* You can store a single filled Vial Belt in a container such as a Backpack safely. They are also easily stored in a cart or horse's saddlebags.
* Worn around the arm or leg, a vial belt provides easy access to the vials stored in it.
* You may Administer a Potion Serum stored in a worn vial belt to yourself as a Bonus Action provided you have a free hand to do so.
* Unless you have another feature stating differently, you may only wear two vial belts at a time.

# Formulae
Brewing a serum requires a known formula to work from in order to produce the desired results. Here are some ways you might learn new formulae:
* Randomly Discovered – Such as written on an old scroll in an abandoned laboratory.
* Purchased – More likely than with things like bombs, check with apothecaries or herbalists you run across to see if they know any formula they can teach you.
* Experimentation – Downtime spent brewing and trying various different approaches to make something as of yet unknown to you.
	* Experimentation consumes resources from the failed attempts, it's up to the DM precisely how this works but here is a sample system:
		* After one hour spent experimenting make an Ability Check using your Herbalist Kit against a DC equal to 15 + the Tier the formula would be from.
			* If you beat the DC you gain one success.
			* On a failure, you consume half the resources it would normally take to brew this serum.
			* If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.
			* Once you have accumulated 3 successed, you learn the formula.
		* If you have some form on Inspiration guiding your experimentation this process is significantly easier, oftentimes only requiring the time with no rolls needed.
