# Basic Mechanics
[Shared Crafting and Formula Mechanics](consumable_shared_mechanics.md)
Canister Bombs are a type of crude explosive that detonates on impact:
* Bombs are considered improvised weapons that can be thrown a range of 30 feet.
* Most bombs require a Saving Throw, the DC is determined by your Bomb DC.
	* Bomb DC: 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Intelligence Modifier.

# Storage and Handling
Canister Bombs are volatile contraptions and can not be haphazardly stored in a backpack without the potential for dire consequence. Precisely what happens if you choose to do so is up to the DM.

Canister Bombs can be safely stored in a bag of holding or similar extradimensional space.

A piece of equipment known as a **Canister Belt** can be crafted using leatherworker's tools and 2 units of Uncommon Leather. It provides the following benefits:
* A canister belt has the capacity to safely store 5 canister bombs.
* Over the course of one minute, you can safely add, remove, or swap any number of bombs from the belt.
* A canister belt loaded with bombs can be safely stored in something like a cart or a horse's saddle bags, but is too bulky to be placed in a regular backpack.
* Worn across the chest as a bandolier, drawing bombs from the belt is exceptionally easy.
* In place of any attack you make on your turn, you can draw and throw a bomb provided you have a free hand to do so.
* Unless you have another feature stating differently, you may only wear one canister belt across your chest as a bandolier.
