# Basic Mechanics
Canister Bombs are a type of crude explosive that all share the following properties:
* You must have the basic knowledge to craft canister bombs in general in order to safely craft *any* bomb.
	* Simply finding a formula is not enough to grant you this knowledge. It must be taught by another or learned in downtime via experimentation.
* Canister Bombs are crafted using Alchemist's Supplies in addition to any needed ingredients.
	* It may be possible to substitue a different tool, such as Tinker's Tools. Check with your DM.
* You must be at least proficient with Alchemist's Supplies in order to craft bombs safely.
* With one hour's work you can safely craft a single bomb from any formulae you know.
* You can attempt to forego safety and rapidly craft a bomb in 10 minutes.
* If you are attempting to craft a bomb in an unsafe manor, you must make an Ability Check with Alchemist's Supplies against a DC equal to 12 + the Tier of the bomb you are trying to make.
	* On a success, you manage to make the bomb.
	* On a failure, you lose half the resources required to make the bomb.
	* If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.
		* The DM may also stipulate that there is some other consequence for a catastrophic failure, such as the bomb detonating in your face with more or less potency than expected.
	* The DM may impose additional modifiers to the DC.
* Most bombs require a Saving Throw, the DC is determined by your Bomb DC.
	* Bomb DC: 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Intelligence Modifier.
* Bombs are considered improvised weapons that can be thrown a range of 30 feet.

# Storage and Handling
Canister Bombs are volatile contraptions and can not be haphazardly stored in a backpack without the potential for dire consequence. Precisely what happens if you choose to do so is up to the DM.

Canister Bombs can be safely stored in a bag of holding or similar extradimensional space.

A piece of equipment known as a ***Canister Belt*** can be crafted using leatherworker's tools and 2 units of Uncommon Leather. It provides the following benefits:
* A canister belt has the capacity to safely store 5 canister bombs.
* Over the course of one minute, you can safely add, remove, or swap any number of bombs from the belt.
* A canister belt loaded with bombs can be safely stored in something like a cart or a horse's saddle bags, but is too bulky to be placed in a regular backpack.
* Worn across the chest as a bandolier, drawing bombs from the belt is exceptionally easy.
* In place of any attack you make on your turn, you can draw and throw a bomb provided you have a free hand to do so.
* Unless you have another feature stating differently, you may only wear one canister belt across your chest as a bandolier.

# Formulae
Crafting a bomb requires a known formula to work from in order to produce the desired results. Here are some ways you might learn new formulae:
* Randomly Discovered – Such as written on an old scroll in an abandoned laboratory.
* Purchased – It'll likely be uncommon, but NPCs have been known to also tinker with explosives.
* Experimentation – Downtime spent crafting and trying various different approaches to make something as of yet unknown to you.
	* Experimentation consumes resources from the failed attempts, it's up to the DM precisely how this works but here is a sample system:
		* After one hour spent experimenting make an Ability Check using your Alchemist's Supplies against a DC equal to 15 + the Tier the formula would be from.
			* If you beat the DC you gain one success.
			* On a failure, you consume half the resources it would normally take to craft this bomb.
			* If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.
			* Once you have accumulated 3 successed, you learn the formula.
		* If you have some form on Inspiration guiding your experimentation this process is significantly easier, oftentimes only requiring the time with no rolls needed.
