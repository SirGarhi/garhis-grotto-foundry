## Tier 3
### Aether Trap
You have devised an aether trap to allow for the containment and directed release of aether.
* The trap has a capacity of 20 charges.
* The trap passively absorbs aether from everything around it at a slow rate.
* At the end of a Long Rest, the trap gains 1d8 + 4 charges.

* With one hour of work you can safely detach the resonator from a weapon.
> #### Upkeep
>* Certain effects of the Resonator require a continual upkeep of aether in addition to the up front cost to activate the effect.
>* Upkeep is accomplished automatically at the start of your turn by drawing aether from a nearby *Aether Trap*, if you don't have enough aether to pay the upkeep cost of a feature, the feature is automatically deactivated.
>* You can end an active feature of the resonator at any time as a free action.
