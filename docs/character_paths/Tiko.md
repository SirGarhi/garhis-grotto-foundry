## Tier 3
* Harmonic Resonator  
	A Harmonic Resonator is installed in the blade of Infinity, allowing for a wide range of effects when the appropriate amount of aether is fed in to it
	* Upkeep
		* Certain effects of the Resonator require a continual upkeep of power in addition to the up front cost to activate the effect
		* Upkeep is accomplished as a Free Action at the start of your turn
* Aether Trap  
	An aether trap is attached to Infinity to allow for the containement and directed release of aether
	* The trap has a capacity of 20 charges
	* The trap passively absorbs aether from everything around it at a slow rate
	* At the end of a Long Rest, the trap gains 1d8 + 4 charges
* Feed the Trap  
	As an Action you can directly feed aether in to the trap in the form of essence
	* Uncommon Essence: 3 charges
	* Rare Essence: 6 charges
	* Very Rare Essence: 10 charges

	* You ignore half and three-quarters cover for any attack roll made using Infinity
* Harnessed Lightning (6 charges, 1 charge Upkeep)  
	As a Bonus Action you release aether from the trap to cause the resonator to begin harnessing energy, causing lightning to coalesce and play about the blade, granting the following benefits:
	* As an Action, pick a point you can see within 40 feet of Infinity
		* Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC
		* A creature takes 3d10 Lightning Damage on a failed save, half-damage on a success
* Directed Power  
	By carefully releasing specific quantities of aether from the trap you are able to cause the resonator to replicate a variety of spell effects
	* These effects function much like the spells they replicate, including the action type required
	* No material component is required other than the resonator itself
	* Any changes to spell functionality are specifically noted
	* The save DC of these effects is equal to your Spell Save DC
		* 1 Charge

	* Actively using the trap by feeding it with essence or powering the resonator interupts this process

	The Aether Trap has been modified to capture the aether that typically escapes when a creature dies or is grievously wounded
