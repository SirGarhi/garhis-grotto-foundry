Angelo is a Human Echo Knight Fighter.

His Path centers primarily around unlocking the hidden powers of ***Blooming Rose***, a unique Katana.

Beautiful and Terrible, *Blooming Rose* is imbued with the vast power of an ancient Fey Lord who died of a broken heart brought on by unrequited love. It is said that the flower petals manifested by the blade are those that fall from the bushes which grow around his grave.
