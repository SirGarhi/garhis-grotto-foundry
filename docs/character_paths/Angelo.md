Angelo is a Human Echo Knight Fighter.

His Path centers around ***Blooming Rose***, a unique Katana.

Beautiful and Terrible, Blooming Rose is imbued with the vast power of an ancient Fey Lord who died of a broken heart brought on by unrequited love. It is said that the flower petals manifested by the blade are those that fall from the bushes which grow around his grave.

# Path Features
## Tier 1
* Blooming Rose - Blooming Rose is a Katana that deals 1d8 Slashing damage and has the Finesse Property. It possesses a Weapon DC which is used in several other Features along the Path.
	- Weapon DC – 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Dexterity Bonus

## Tier 2
* Lethality – Blooming Rose gains a +1 bonus to its Attack, Damage, and Weapon DC.
* Petal Slash – Whenever you hit a creature with Blooming Rose you can inflict an additional 1d4 Slashing Damage to the target or another creature within 5 feet of the target.
* Petal Swarm – When a creature within 5 feet of you or your Echo hits you or your Echo with a melee attack you can use a reaction to roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll.

## Tier 3
* Sharpened Blade – The base damage of Blooming Rose increases to 1d8 + 1d4.
* Petal Vortex Technique – As an action you can begin performing an intricate pattern of movements with Blooming Rose, causing petals to manifest and swirl about in a 10-foot diameter around you. The vortex moves with you, remaining centered on you. This technique lasts for 10 minutes and requires you to maintain concentration, as if concentrating on a spell.
	- While this technique is active you can’t take reactions, but can direct streams of petals outwards, giving your melee attacks a range of 30 feet.
	- The vortex only affects creatures of your choice, and those creatures’ speed is halved while in the vortex. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity Saving Throw against your Weapon DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d8 Slashing Damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage.
	- You can use this technique once, and regain the ability to do so after a Long Rest.

## Tier 4
* Improved Lethality – The bonus from Lethality increases to +2.
* Guardian Petals – You now roll 1d6 when using Petal Swarm and it can be triggered by an attack against an ally as well as yourself. The creature making the attack must still be within 5 feet of either you or your Echo.
* Guardian Petal Swarm – While Petal Vortex Technique is active, you gain access to Guardian Petal Swarm, which functions as Petal Swarm but can be triggered by any creature within the vortex. You can use Guardian Petal Swarm against a number of attacks equal to your Dexterity Modifier, regaining all uses at the start of your turn. You still can’t take any other Reactions.
* Deep Reserves – The radius of Blooming Rose Technique increases to 15 feet and you can use it twice, regaining all uses on a Long Rest.

## Tier 5
* Thorns Among the Petals – Petal Slash now also inflicts 2d4 Piercing Damage. Petal Vortex Technique now also inflicts 4d4 Piercing Damage.
* The Duality of Man – Your Echo now also manifests a Vortex when you use Petal Vortex Technique.

## Tier 6
* Greater Lethality – The bonus from Lethality increases to +3. Your Critical Hit threshold is reduced by 1.
* White Rose Blade – While Petal Vortex Technique is active, you can use a Free Action at the start of your turn to end the vortex early and concentrate all the energy in to your blade. If you do, all weapon attacks with Blooming Rose deal an additional 4d12 Force Damage until the end of your turn.

# Path Goals
* TBD, but probably something about training with other Master Swordsmen
