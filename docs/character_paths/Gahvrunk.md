Gahvrunk is a Bugbear Totem Warrior Barbarian.

His Path focuses on enhancing his Totem abilities as well as granting additional or unique ways to make weapon attacks.

# Path Features
## Tier 1
* Reckless Rampage – When you Recklessly attack and hit with at least one attack, you may make an additional attack as a bonus action.
* Bracers of the Totem Warrior – A set of battered bracers engraved with multiple symbols and runes representing animal spirits. These bracers require attunement and to be actively worn to access the associated features.
* Shamanistic Training – Whenever you finish a long rest while attuned to the Bracers of the Totem Warrior, you may choose one Totem Spirit that you did not choose as part of your class training. You gain the effect of that spirit until you take your next long rest.
* Sustain the Rage – If your rage is going to end at the end of your turn, either early or due to the duration expiring you can use a Reaction to sustain it. If you do, the duration of your rage resets to the full 60 seconds and it will not end until the end of your next turn at the earliest.
	- You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all uses at the end of a long rest.

## Tier 2
* Barbaric Fury – Pick one melee weapon that does not already possess at least a +1 bonus to Attack or Damage. With a one hour ritual, which can be done over a short rest, you can imbue some of your rage in to the weapon, making it a ***Weapon of Barbaric Fury***. You gain a +1 bonus to Attack and Damage rolls with that weapon and its attacks are considered magical until you use this feature on a different weapon or choose to withdraw your rage from it as a Free Action.
* Runic Etchings – Runes of power are etched in to the Bracers of the Totem Warrior. You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and Saving Throws while attuned to and wearing them.

## Tier 3
* Whirlwind Attack – As an action, make one weapon attack against each creature and object within 5 feet. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this attack you may move towards another creature not yet targeted by this attack and repeat the attack, targeting each creature and object within 5 feet. This movement uses your standard movement for the turn and provokes opportunity attacks. You may repeat this pattern as long as you have remaining movement and a valid target to move to.
* Subdued Recklessness – When you use your Reckless Attack feature, you can choose to do so in a more controlled manor. If you do, you take a -2 penalty to your Attack Rolls on this turn but you do not grant Advantage on attack rolls against you.
* Advanced Shamanism – You may now choose an Aspect of the Beast with your Shamanistic Training. You still only choose one feature.

## Tier 4
* Improved Fury – A *Weapon of Barbaric Fury* now has a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage for you.
* Runic Engravings – Additional engravings are added to the Bracers of the Totem Warrior. Its bonus to AC and Saving Throws increases to +2.

## Tier 5
* Rampaging Fury – Reckless Rampage now allows you to make two attacks with your bonus action. Your Whirlwind Attack no longer needs to reduce a creature to 0 hit points for you to repeat the attack.
* Master Shamanism – You may now choose two features with your Shamanistic Training, and one of them may be a Totemic Attunement.

## Tier 6
* Master Fury – A *Weapon of Barbaric Fury* now has a +3 bonus to Attack and Damage for you. It's critical hit threshold is also reduced by 1.
* Runic Inscription – The magical bonus from Runic Etchings increases to +3.
