Cillian is a human Battle Master fighter.

Her Path centers around specialized fighting techniques, upgrades to her prosthetic arm, and the crafting of various consumables.

Any feature designated (Arm Feature) is tightly coupled to the arm and can't be used if the arm is not both equipped and attuned.
