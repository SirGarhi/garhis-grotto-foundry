Taelyx is an Indensian (Crash-Landed Space Alien) Arcana Cleric.

Indensian culture venerates their ancestral spirits and  the spirits are often called upon to bring aid in all manner of activity, including battle. Whether Indensians truly gain assistance from the spirits of their forebears or simply know a different way of harnessing aether is a subject of debate. There is however no denying the strength of arms brought to bear against their enemies in the conquest that secured dominance across the entirety of their homeworld.

His Path focuses on fulfilling his cultural obligations as a Warden, maintaining his people's style of fighting on a foreign world, and rising to his potential so he can return home and liberate his people from tyranny.
