# Crafting an Item
You must have the feature allowing you to craft the consumable type in general in order to safely and reliably craft *any* of that type of consumable, even if working from a formula.
> Simply finding a formula is not enough to grant you this feature. It must be taught by another or learned in downtime via experimentation.

**Tools Required** – Each type of consumable has an associated tool that is generally used to craft it. Check with your DM to see if you can use a different type of tool instead.
* Potion Serums are brewed with an Herbalism Kit
* Weapon Oils are brewed with a Poisoner's Kit
* Canister Bombs are crafted with an Alchemist's Kit

You must be at least proficient with the tool used in order to create an item safely.

With one hour's work you can safely create a single item from any formulae you know by expending the appropriate resources.

You can attempt to forego safety and rapidly craft an item in 10 minutes.

If you are attempting to craft an item in an unsafe manor, you must make an Ability Check with your tool against a DC equal to 12 + the Tier of the item you are trying to make.
* On a success, you manage to make the item.
* On a failure, you lose half the resources required to make the item.
* If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.
> The DM may also stipulate that there is some other consequence for a catastrophic failure, such as accidentally poisoning yourself, inflicting the intended effects of a weapon oil on yourself, or having a bomb blow up in your face.
> 
> The DM may impose additional modifiers to the DC.

# Acquiring New Formulae
Whether you're brewing serums or oils, or making bombs, you need to work from an established formula to get predictable results.

Here are some ways you might learn new formulae:
* **Randomly Discovered** – Such as written on an old scroll in an abandoned laboratory.
* **Purchased** – Check with other practitioners such as Apothecaries, Herbalists, or members of the Explosives Guild to see if they know any formulae they will sell or teach you.
* **Experimentation** – Downtime spent trying various different approaches to make something as of yet unknown to you.
	* Experimentation consumes resources from the failed attempts, it's up to the DM precisely how this works but here is a sample system:
		* After one hour spent experimenting make an Ability Check using your tool against a DC equal to 15 + the Tier the formula would be from.
		* If you beat the DC you gain one success.
		* On a failure, you consume half the resources it would normally take to brew this serum.
		* If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.
		* Once you have accumulated 3 successes, you learn the formula.
	* If you have some form on Inspiration guiding your experimentation this process is significantly easier, oftentimes only requiring the time with no rolls needed.
