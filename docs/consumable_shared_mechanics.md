# Specialty Consumables
Specialty consumables can't be crafted by just anyone; they require you to have dedicated training in addition to any tool or skill proficiencies required. This is represented by a passive feature earned via a Character Path. Crafting features come in three ranks, and each type of specialty consumable requires its own feature.
* Rank 1 allows crafting Tier 1 and Tier 2 formulae.
* Rank 2 allows crafting Tier 3 and Tier 4 formulae.
* Rank 3 allows crafting Tier 5 and Tier 6 formulae.

## Tools Required
Each type of consumable has an associated tool that is generally used to craft it. Check with your DM to see if you can use a different type of tool instead.
* Potions and Potion Serums are brewed with Alchemy Supplies.
* Weapon Oils, Poisons, and Coatings are made with a Poisoner's Kit.
* Canister Bombs are crafted with Alchemy Supplies.
* Arrows or Bolts are crafted with Woodcarver's Tools.
* Bullets are crafted with Tinker's Tools.

You must be at least proficient with the tool used in order to create an item safely.

With one hour's work you can safely create a single output from any formula you know by expending the appropriate resources, no checks are required.

You can attempt to forego safety and rapidly craft one output in 10 minutes.

## Unsafe Crafting
If you are attempting to craft in an unsafe manor, you must make an Ability Check with your tool against a Base DC equal to 10 + the Tier of the item you are trying to make, modified based on what factors are making the crafting attempt unsafe:
* Not being proficient in the tool you are using: +5
* Rapid Crafting: +3
* Any other modifiers the DM feels are appropriate, such as an environmental factor like being in the back of a jostling cart.
> As with any check, the DM may not even allow an attempt if the modified DC is too high to be realistically accomplished.
* On a success, you manage to produce one output from the formula.
* On a failure, you lose half the resources required to make the item.
* If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.
The DM may also stipulate that there is some other consequence for a catastrophic failure, such as accidentally poisoning yourself or having a bomb blow up in your face.
