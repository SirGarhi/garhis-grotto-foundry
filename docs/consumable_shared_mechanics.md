# Crafting from a Formula
Crafting a consumable *safely* requires you to have a feature granting you the ability to craft that type of consumable *in general*, this is known as a Core Feature.
* Crafting Potion Serums requires the *Potion Serums* core feature.
* Crafting Canister Bombs requires the *Canister Bombs* core feature.
* Etc.
---
* Simply finding a formula for a specific consumable is not enough to grant you that consumable type's core feature.
* Core features are most commonly earned by being taught by another.
* Core features can be earned through downtime via Experimenting.
* In order to attempt to earn a Core Feature through Experimenting, you must know a specific formula for a consumable of that type.
	* You must actually *know* a formula, not simply have an Inspiration for one.

> Without working from a known formula, the resulting output is entirely unpredictable and up to the DM's whimsy.

## Tools Required
Each type of consumable has an associated tool that is generally used to craft it. Check with your DM to see if you can use a different type of tool instead.
* Potions and Potion Serums are brewed with an Herbalism Kit.
* Weapon Oils, Poisons, and Coatings are made with a Poisoner's Kit.
* Canister Bombs are crafted with an Alchemist's Kit.
* Arrows or Bolts are crafted with Woodcarver's Tools.
* Bullets are crafted with Tinker's Tools.

You must be at least proficient with the tool used in order to create an item safely.

With one hour's work you can safely create a single output from any formulae you know by expending the appropriate resources.

You can attempt to forego safety and rapidly craft one output in 10 minutes.

## Unsafe Crafting
If you are attempting to craft in an unsafe manor, you must make an Ability Check with your tool against a Base DC equal to 10 + the Tier of the item you are trying to make, modified based on what factors are making the crafting attempt unsafe:
* Not having the core feature to craft that type of consumable: +5
* Not being proficient in the tool you are using: +5
* Rapid Crafting: +3
* Any other modifiers the DM feels are appropriate, such as an environmental factor like being in the back of a jostling cart.
> As with any check, the DM may not even allow an attempt if the modified DC is too high to be realistically accomplished.
* On a success, you manage to produce one output from the formula.
* On a failure, you lose half the resources required to make the item.
* If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.  
The DM may also stipulate that there is some other consequence for a catastrophic failure, such as accidentally poisoning yourself or having a bomb blow up in your face.

# Acquiring New Formulae
Whatever type of consumable you're crafting, you need to work from an established formula to get predictable results.

Here are some ways you might learn new formulae:
* Randomly Discovered – Such as written on an old scroll in an abandoned laboratory.
* Purchased – Check with other practitioners such as Apothecaries, Herbalists, or members of the Explosives Guild to see if they know any formulae they will sell or teach you.
* Experimentation – Downtime spent trying various different approaches to make something as of yet unknown to you.
	* Experimentation to develop a formula requires that you have the core feature for that type of consumable.
	* Experimentation consumes resources from the failed attempts, it's up to the DM precisely how this works but here is a sample system:
		* After one hour spent experimenting make an Ability Check using your tool against a DC equal to 15 + the Tier the formula would be from.
		* If you beat the DC you gain one success.
		* On a failure, you consume half the resources it would normally take to brew this serum.
		* If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.
		* Once you have accumulated 3 successes, you learn the formula.
	* #### Inspiration
		* Certain things can clue your character in to new types of consumables being possible. In such an instance, you are considered to have an *Inspiration* for that specific consumable.
		* You don't need to have the core feature for a type of consumable to earn an Inspiration for a consumable of that type, but you must first earn the core feature before you can actually develop a formula based on the Inspiration.
		* Developing a formula from an Inspiration is significantly easier than coming up with an idea from scratch, and only requires you dedicate the downtime to experimenting with no checks needed.
	* Some Sample Inspirations:
		* Harvesting Mimic Adhesive could grant Inspiration for a Glue Bomb.
		* Being subjected to a Wall of Fire spell could grant Inspiration for a Blaze Bomb.
		* Being on the receiving end of a nasty poison could grant Inspiration for a Weapon Oil with similar effect.
		* Drinking a potion you don't know the formula for, or seeing an unknown bomb type in action may grant you Inspiration to replicate that consumable.
