# Basic Mechanics
[Shared Crafting and Formula Mechanics](consumable_shared_mechanics.md)

Arcane Ammunition refers to any ammunition that is infused with magical energy in some fashion.

In addition to the standard requirements, crafting arcane ammo safely requires proficiency in the *Arcana* skill.

* Some Ammunition types require a Saving Throw, the DC is determined by your Ammo DC.
	* Ammo DC: 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Dexterity Modifier.

# Storage and Handling
Ammunition, even of an arcane variety, doesn't require any special care while handling or storing it. It is, however, bulky. Ammunition is generally carried in dedicated containers that hold 20 pieces of ammunition.

> Player Note: The idea here is **be reasonable**. You should be able to carry a decent quantity of different types of ammunition, but not all of it will be readily accessible in the event of a sudden ambush.
>
> Having 3 or 4 quivers or ammo pouches "equipped" and readily accessible is reasonable. Having 10 so you have every non physical damage type at hand is pushing it.

# Formulae
This is not an exhaustive list. If you have ideas for your own type of ammunition, by all means propose them to the DM.
