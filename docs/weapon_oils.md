# Basic Mechanics
Weapon Oils are an oily coating applied to a typically bladed weapon to grant it additional temporary properties.
* You must have the basic knowledge of brewing Weapon Oils in general in order to safely brew *any* oil.
	* Simply finding a formula is not enough to grant you this knowledge. It must be taught by another or learned in downtime via experimentation.
* Weapon Oils are brewed using a Poisoner's Kit in addition to any needed ingredients.
	* It may be possible to substitue a different tool, such as Alchemist's Supplies or an Herbalism Kit. Check with your DM.
* You must be at least proficient with a Poisoner's Kit in order to brew oils safely.
* With one hour's work you can safely brew a single oil from any formulae you know.
* You can attempt to forego safety and rapidly brew an oil in 10 minutes.
* If you are attempting to brew an oil in an unsafe manor, you must make an Ability Check with a Poisoner's Kit against a DC equal to 12 + the Tier of the oil you are trying to make.
	* On a success, you manage to make the oil.
	* On a failure, you lose half the resources required to make the oil.
	* If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.
		* The DM may also stipulate that there is some other consequence for a catastrophic failure, such as inflicting the intended effects of the oil on yourself.
	* The DM may impose additional modifiers to the DC.
* A oil can be applied to a weapon as an Action.
* Oils persist on the weapon for one minute, or until a successful attack is made with the weapon.
* Some oils require a Saving Throw, the DC is determined by your Oil DC.
	* Oil DC: 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Intelligence Modifier.

# Formulae
Brewing an oil requires a known formula to work from in order to produce the desired results. Here are some ways you might learn new formulae:
* Randomly Discovered – Such as written on an old scroll in an abandoned laboratory.
* Purchased – The techniques of making weapon oils are not common, you are more likely to find transferrable knowledge from those that dabble in Poisons.
* Experimentation – Downtime spent brewing and trying various different approaches to make something as of yet unknown to you.
	* Experimentation consumes resources from the failed attempts, it's up to the DM precisely how this works but here is a sample system:
		* After one hour spent experimenting make an Ability Check using your Herbalist Kit against a DC equal to 15 + the Tier the formula would be from.
			* If you beat the DC you gain one success.
			* On a failure, you consume half the resources it would normally take to brew this oil.
			* If you fail by 5 or more, you lose all the resources.
			* Once you have accumulated 3 successed, you learn the formula.
		* If you have some form on Inspiration guiding your experimentation this process is significantly easier, oftentimes only requiring the time with no rolls needed.

# Sample Formuale
This is not an exhaustive list. If you have ideas for your own type of oil, by all means propose them to the DM.

## Tier 1
### Physical Impact Oil (15 gold)
* Deals 2d6 damage of the weapon's type.
### Elemental Impact Oil (25 gold) [Fire, Acid, Cold, Lightning]
* Deals 2d6 damage of the associated type on a successful hit.
### Elemental Lingering Oil (25 gold) [Fire, Acid, Cold, Lightning]
* A creature hit by a weapon coated in this oil must make a Dexterity Saving Throw. 
* On a failure, the creature's body is coated by the oil and they take 2d4 damage of the appropriate type at the start of their turn for three turns.

## Tier 2
### Esoteric Impact Oil (50 gold) [Force, Psychic, Radiant, Necrotic, Thunder]
* Deals 2d6 damage of the associated type on any successful hit.
### Esoteric Lingering Oil (50 gold) [Force, Psychic, Radiant, Necrotic, Thunder]
* A creature hit with a weapon coated in this oil must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
* On a failure, the creature's body is suffesed with the oil and they take 2d4 damage of the appropriate type at the start of their turn for three turns.
