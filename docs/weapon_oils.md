# Basic Mechanics
[Shared Crafting and Formula Mechanics](consumable_shared_mechanics.md)
Weapon Oils are an oily coating applied to a typically bladed weapon to grant it additional temporary properties.
* An oil can be applied to a weapon as an Action.
* Oils persist on the weapon for one minute, or until a successful attack is made with the weapon.
* Some oils require a Saving Throw, the DC is determined by your Oil DC.
	* Oil DC: 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Intelligence Modifier.

# Storage and Handling
Unlike Serums and Bombs, Weapon Oils don't require any particularly special handling. You can easily hang a small pot of weapon oil from many different places on your belt in easy reach to apply in combat.

> Player Note: The name of the game here is **be reasonable**. There are no explicit restrictions as to how you can safely carry weapon oils, but it's not intended that you have multiple uses of every type of oil you know available to you in combat.
>
> 4-6 Individual oils? Sure, but the rest are probably in a bag of holding or backpack and would require some sort of inventory action to get access to.
>
> If you're using your 12th oil in the same combat without doing any sort of explicit inventory access, expect the DM to call shenanigans.

# Formulae
